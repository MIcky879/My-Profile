				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Basic background: Australian born Chinese, Fourth year university student study at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am fluent in English and have basic knowledge of speaking mandarin and Japanese. My interest includes all forms of pop culture, technology, weightlifting, and socialising. Below you will find an image of an animated character I like. Zenitsu from Demon Slayer</p>

				<h2>Intrest in Information Technology</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>My interest in Information Technology predominately started with games, which I have played since primary school. As I progressed into high school, I was able to take up IT as an elective, in which I learnt of image editing, the basics of reading and typing in various programming languages, the basics of internet security, simple application making and basic game development. During the elective, my teacher at the time had the sparked my interest in IT, he had made the learning experience enjoyable, and I learnt that coding and designing applications and games was a fun way to have a creative output.</p>
				</section>



				<section>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>I originally applied to the Royal Melbourne institute of technology, due to having a lower than required ATAR evaluation than expected. RMIT enabled me to continue my goals in studying in engineering, via a pathway from an associate degree to the Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. After arriving to RMIT, I enjoyed the university study environment much more than the education of secondary school. I hope to continue my studies and graduate from RMIT.</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>Having chosen to study a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering, I expected to learn new concepts in the field of engineering and how they applied to real world situations. As I had an interest in technology, I was eager to learn and develop my understanding of the everyday machinery around me. How they worked, how they were powered and how they were manufactured. </p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			<!-- Image -->
			<img src="img/JobTitle.jpg">
			</header>			  
			<p>For now, the ideal job I seek is being a Mechanical Engineering Draftsman. The expectations of the occupation include: Aiding the marketing staff with quoting the material cost and expenses. Designing and developing the 3D models of possible parts, whilst supplying the supporting documentation. Assisting and track the progress of designs in major projects.  This job in particular interest me due to including one of the main areas of engineering I enjoy, which would be the modelling of possible parts used in the industry. The use of 3D models in manufacturing anything, allows for a much easier time to reconstruct and recreate possible parts and secure a safe copy being in digital form. </p>
			<p>There are many qualifications and skills needed to acquire this type of job. Namely having completed a degree in higher education of engineering, and the being of proficient in of the many 3d modelling programs such as Auto CAD or Solid works. This job in particular is a graduate role, thus having the benefit of allowing students to apply for the role as soon as they graduate. </p>
			<p>Regrettable, I do not currently have any extracurricular qualification or experience of working in the engineering field. My main experiences in the field, are my current studies at RMIT university and working in our areas of the general work force. However, due to my studies at RMIT, I do have knowledge of multiple concepts of mechanical engineering and have acceptable use in both the programs Solid works and Auto CAD.  </p>
			<p>The main priority right now in aiding myself to entering the workforce and getting this type of job, is graduating from university, and acquiring an internship at one of the many well established engineering firms. Whilst also, honing my skills at all possible programs which may aid me in the workforce. </p>

			<p>Overall, these test results mean quite little to me, as I do not believe that humans can be categories in these personality labels.  I do understand that my personality is quite introverted, labelling it as such does not teach me much about myself. I was curious about the learning type test as to see if it would enlighten me in a better way to aid my studying. However, I am currently unsure on how to implement that type of learning style to my current work. </p>
			<p>In correlation, to my behaviour while working in groups, I believe this information may help me be more mindful of the drawbacks of working with me. Thus, I plan to try mitigating the possible things that may be disruptive to a good work environment, whilst working with others. </p>
			<p>When forming a possible team to work with on a project, this information will aid me to seek out possible compatible people who will benefit me by offering help in the areas, I have the most drawbacks in. Whilst also aiding others, in the areas which they maybe having trouble in. </p>

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Design and development of an multi player shooter game in a battle royal setting, themed around RMIT where the players are students aiming to hand in an assignment. The game will be a timed battle, in which a group of players will enter as teams and try to survive to the end. The arena would be based around the CBD, and to prevent players from being immobile, a ring called the “Deadline” will periodically shrink and deal dmg to the players, if they are touched by it. The goal of the game would be, to be the last surviving team at the end of the game, this would be achieved by other being the last team surviving at the last ring or by eliminating the other players. </p>
				
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>This project is designed by a student, for students. Games are designed to be a fun enjoyable experience aimed to help whoever plays them destress and enjoy themselves. The project is to be themed around the RMIT university and the CBD and parodied to seem comedic. This is in hope any RMIT student that plays this game would gain some cathartic feelings from digitally shooting other students and destress themselves from the possible emotional turmoil gained from the workload of their studies. The projects end goal is that, for whoever that plays this has fun and enjoys playing the project. </p>
				<p>Disclaimer, the project, and team does not in any way condone the act of shooting of students,murder,taking of life,theft, etc. </p>
				
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>These are Key functions needed in this game:</p>
				<p>The player: must be able to move in all directions in 360 degrees, change the speed of movement to sprint and back to walk to suit the player, interact with the environment or items, pick up items, aim in the direction of shooting the firearm, shoot and reload said firearm, have a health point pool which can be damaged and when reduced to zero will exit the game. </p>
				<p>The ring: periodically closes in at fixed intervals, pausing to give players time to re-enter the ring or to re locate within it. Also, it would deal damage to the player’s health point pool, if the player is outside of it, this damage would scale in intensity given how many rings have passed within the game.</p>
				<p>The map: should direct players to the centre of the ring as it is the main goal of the game, a mini map would accompany the player for quality-of-life map viewing. A full map would be possible to be viewed and closed at a button press. Landmarks on the map would be outlined, stating if the loot in the area would be high quality or not.</p>
				<p>Loot Boxes: need to be interactable, able to provide players with possible loot, namely, a gun, armour, ammo, healing items, these would be provided at a random rate and varying in quality based off its location, randomized each game.</p>
				<p>Guns: to be pick up able and would be categorised by type, differentiating from each other via effective range, magazine size, damage per pellet, and accuracy per shoot. </p>
				<p>Armour: to be pick up able and will act as an additional health point pool in which can be used to shield the players normal health point pool, and able to evolve though damage cause by the player, leveling up to 4 levels having a larger health pool at each level. </p>
				<p>Classes: Specialised classes would be based off student programs, each with possible unique passives or active actions. Engineering students would increase the magazine size of the gun they currently have equipped. Medical student would passively heal their health pool at a slow periodic pace. Physical education students would have an increased movement speed, be it running or walking. Information technology students would have a specialised interaction in which, they would interact with a computer and the next location that ring would pause at, would be displayed on their map only.  </p>
				
				<h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
				<p>The main tool needed to complete this project would be some type of programming software that has the capability to code and generate the game itself. Possible programs which would be noteworthy are Unity or game maker. To run the project as it is design to be a multiplayer game, an individual would need to set up a server to host the lobby for the participants. The game’s development is aimed towards running on a computer as the use of a mouse and keyboard allow the most user-friendly approach to the designed controls of the game, no design has been set up for the game to be a mobile application or on console devices yet. Depending on where the game design goes, other a 3d modelling program or an digital drawing program would be needed to design the landscape, playable characters and items in game. </p>
				
				<h3>Skills Required </h3>
				<p>The key skills required to design and develop this project would be knowledge in a coding language, preferable one which is usable in Unity or Game maker. Depending on the game design being 3D or 2D, knowledge of making 3D character and item models or have the artistic skill to draw and design a sprite model is needed. Given the time frame of 6 weeks, I believe with a lot of effort, it is possible to learn to code the basic functions of the project. Simple game models or drawing up poor art will do for the aesthetics of the game. Probably the hardest job, would be learning to program the game to be multiplayer as that is the core aspect of the game. </p>
				
				<h3>Outcome </h3>
				<p>Within the time frame of 6 weeks, the most ideal outcome of the design and development of this project would be a simple demo is finalised and is running by the final week. The core elements and functions of the game would be usable without bugs, and you would be able to set up a server and run the game on whatever computer you run the executable on. As per the motivation of the project, aiming to lessen the stress levels of the students who play the game, if the game helps destress or bring any enjoyment to said player. The project has served its purposed of its development. </p>
